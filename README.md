## Installation

```shell
$ npm install comparejs
```

## Quick Start

To use comparejs you need to reference it from your application by adding the following line:

```javascript
const compare = require('comparejs').default;
```

```typescript
import compare from 'comparejs';
```

### Features

- Supports comparison of `array`, `boolean`, `function`, `null`, `number`, `object`, `string` and `undefined`.
- Supports comparison of native data types and constructor-created data types, such as `number` and `new Number()`.
- Supports comparison of objects and arrays using deep-equal.
- Supports comparison of objects and arrays with `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` by handling them as subsets.
- Supports comparison of objects by structure.
- Supports comparison with `undefined` correctly, as `<=` and `>=` are problematic in plain JavaScript.
- Supports comparison in a perfectly type-safe way out-of-the-box.
- Supports comparison by equality and identity, depending on what makes sense.

### Basic usage

Now you are able to use the various comparison operators. All you need to do is access the `compare` object and use its functions:

| Operator                          | Â Alias             | Description           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| `equal(left, right)`              | `eq(left, right)`  | equal                 |
| `notEqual(left, right)`           | `ne(left, right)`  | not equal             |
| `lessThan(left, right)`           | `lt(left, right)`  | less than             |
| `lessThanOrEqual(left, right)`    | `lte(left, right)` | less than or equal    |
| `greaterThan(left, right)`        | `gt(left, right)`  | greater than          |
| `greaterThanOrEqual(left, right)` | `gte(left, right)` | greater than or equal |
| `identity(left, right)`           | `id(left, right)`  | identity              |

Please note that each comparison operator works on each combination of types and does what you would expect it to do.

### Structure comparison operators

For objects, there are special operators that compare by structure. Among other things, they can be used to verify objects against interfaces:

| Operator                                     | Alias               | Description                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `equalByStructure(left, right)`              | `eqs(left, right)`  | equal by structure                 |
| `notEqualByStructure(left, right)`           | `nes(left, right)`  | not equal by structure             |
| `lessThanByStructure(left, right)`           | `lts(left, right)`  | less than by structure             |
| `lessThanOrEqualByStructure(left, right)`    | `ltes(left, right)` | less than or equal by structure    |
| `greaterThanByStructure(left, right)`        | `gts(left, right)`  | greater than by structure          |
| `greaterThanOrEqualByStructure(left, right)` | `gtes(left, right)` | greater than or equal by structure |

Please note that these operators only work for objects. For any other type, they return `false`.
